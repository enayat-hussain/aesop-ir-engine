## üîç Overview  
A modular IR system implementing classic retrieval models to search through Aesop's Fables. Supports Boolean, Vector Space, and Signature-Based models with precision/recall evaluation.  

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Multiple Retrieval Models**:  
  - Boolean (Linear, Inverted Index, Signature-Based)  
  - Vector Space (TF-IDF)  
  - *Fuzzy Set (Planned)*  
- **Text Processing**:  
  - Porter Stemmer  
  - Stopword filtering (Crouch's frequency-based method)  
- **CLI Interface**: Interactive menu for indexing, searching, and evaluation.  
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and query execution time.
